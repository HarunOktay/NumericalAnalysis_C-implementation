# NumericalAnalysis_C-implementation7
Numerical analysis methods coded by Harun OKTAY, 2022 Spring. I coded numerical methods C implementation for Numerical Analysis Course, final project. 
This program contains;
Find approximate roots with "Bisection", "Regula-Falsi" and "Newton-Raphson" Methods,
Solve sets of linear equations with "Gauss-Elimination" method and "Gauss-Seidel" method,
Inverse of NxN matrix with "Gauss-Jordan" method,
approximate an integral with "Trapezoidal" and "Simpson 1/3 or Simpson 1/8" methods,
Numerical differentation,
Gregory-Newton Interpolation.
I united all methods in one C program, and this repository contains all methods seperately.
